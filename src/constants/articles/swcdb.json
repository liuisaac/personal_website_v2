For a given typo w, it selects the word c that maximizes P(c | w) ‚àù P(w | c) * P(c), where P(c) is based on word frequency from a large corpus, and P(w | c) is based on the likelihood of typos (insertions, deletions, swaps, and replacements) measured by edit distance. This algorithm is ideal for correcting common typos in a small subset of words (ie: part names) and runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of words in the dictionary. Thus, we are able to avoid the use of ML or more expensive solutions that would require a considerbly larger dataset of typos and their corrections."
