Polaris offer real-time navigation, personalized event recommendations, mentor tracking, and even snack truck locations. A localized front-back photo pair system, inspired by BeReal, was implemented to add a personal and authentic touch to each distinct location. Whether itâ€™s optimizing schedules, finding mentors, or knowing where others are in real-time, this project aims to ensure a seamless and immersive experience at any large-scale event.",
